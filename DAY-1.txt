Prompt Engineering is a unique appropriate way of writing a text that enables AI to refine or generate the response based on given inputs.
Formula:
(instruction)+(content)+(format)+(constraints)+(role)
Types of prompts:
•	Instructional prompt:
In this we only tell the AI what to do.
Example: what are computers?
•	Role Based prompt:
Here we assign AI a persona for better behaviour of that particular rolethat we give to AI. It is the best case possible.
Example: telling AI to act as a writer.
•	Few shots prompt:
In this we give some example to add on that particular topic we need.
Example: Add trees on the both sides of the building.
•	Zero shots prompt:
We do not give any example to AI which makes it less better as AI do not get proper details.
Example: Draw something.
•	Chain Of Thoughts (COT) prompt:
This is considered as the better case as we ask the AI to reason the output step by step for better accuracy.
Example: solve the Pythagoras theorem step by step.
•	Constraints based prompt:
This prompt is also good as we put some limits and rules on AI for some topics.
Example: make a c program without using branching conditions.
•	Reframing prompt:
Here we tell the AI to rewrite the prompt or refine it.

TOOLS FOR PROMPT ENGINEERING:
There are some tools which can be used for prompt engineering:
